# Machine Learning MOOC

This repository contains all of my Python code submissions in relation to the Machine Learning MOOC organised by Code First Girls.

All solutions were coded using Google Colaboratory.

## Labs completed:
* [Lab #1 - K-Nearest Neighbour](https://github.com/tidimatthias/machine-learning-mooc/blob/main/Lab_K_Nearest_Neighbour.ipynb)
* [Lab #2 - Linear Regression](https://github.com/tidimatthias/machine-learning-mooc/blob/main/Lab_Linear_Regression.ipynb)
* [Lab #3 - Artificial Neuron Networks](https://github.com/tidimatthias/machine-learning-mooc/blob/main/Lab_Artificial_Neuron_Networks.ipynb)

## Challenge completed:
* [Challenge #1 - Pre-trained model](https://github.com/tidimatthias/machine-learning-mooc/blob/main/Challenge_pre_trained_model.ipynb)

Upon completion I was certified by Code First Girls: [**click here**](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AmsqrPxrw1gOtHJeXdvsZsYzFeaB?e=kctFXK)
