# Machine Learning Project

This repository contains all of my Python code submissions in relation to the Machine Learning MOOC organised by Code First Girls.

All solutions were coded using Google Colaboratory.

## Projects completed:
* [Project #1 - K-Nearest Neighbour](https://github.com/tmatthias/machine-learning-mooc/blob/main/K_Nearest_Neighbour.ipynb)
* [Project #2 - Linear Regression](https://github.com/tmatthias/machine-learning-mooc/blob/main/Linear_Regression.ipynb)
* [Project #3 - Artificial Neuron Networks](https://github.com/tmatthias/machine-learning-mooc/blob/main/Artificial_Neuron_Networks.ipynb)

## Challenge(s):
* [Challenge #1 - Pre-trained model](https://github.com/tmatthias/machine-learning-mooc/blob/main/ML_Pretrained_Model.ipynb)
* [Challenge #2 - Bounding Boxes](https://github.com/tmatthias/machine-learning-mooc/blob/main/ML_Bounding_Boxes.ipynb)
